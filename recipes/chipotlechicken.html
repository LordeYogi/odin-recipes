    <h3>Why Homemade Chipotle Chicken?</h3>
    <p>I don’t know about you but I LOVE copycat recipes!</p>

       <p> I mean, what’s not to love when you get to enjoy a delicious homemade version of your favorite restaurant dish at a fraction of the price that you can, if you wish, make in bulk or vary according to your preferences.</p>
       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>7 oz. Can chipotles in adobo sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped red onion</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>Juice of 2 limes about 1⁄4 cup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
        <li>4-6 thin-sliced boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
       </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Combine all ingredients except for the chicken in the bowl of a food processor or blender. Pulse several times to make a marinade paste.</li>
    <li> Place chicken breasts and marinade into a gallon size plastic bag and seal closed. Squish around the chicken and marinade so that all the chicken is fully coated. Refrigerate for a minimum of 3 hours.</li>
    <li> After chicken has marinated, pre-heat grill on high heat for 15 minutes. Remove chicken from marinade and discard bag. Place chicken on grill and cook on each side for 10-12 minutes or until chicken is cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F. </li>
        <li>Adjust grill heat while cooking to ensure that there is a little bit of char, but the meat does not burn or catch on fire.</li>
        Remove cooked chicken from the grill and let rest for 5 minutes. Chop into pieces and serve with tacos, rice bowls, salads, etc.</li>
</ol>
